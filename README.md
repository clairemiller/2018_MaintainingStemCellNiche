# Miller, C., Crampin, E., Osborne, J. (2018). Maintaining the stem cell niche in multicellular models of epithelia.

This project provides all code required, additional to Chaste core code, to reproduce the results and plots shown in the above paper. 

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

Chaste

For rate plots: exponentialsurvival

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the simulations

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system
